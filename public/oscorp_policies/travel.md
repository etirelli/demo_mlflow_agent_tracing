**Subject:** New and Sinister Corporate Travel Policy

Dear Minions of OSCORP,

In accordance with our relentless pursuit of global domination, I, Dr. Octavius, hereby decree the following sinister updates to our corporate travel policy. All travelers must now book flights exclusively through **DarkJet**, the airline that flies on black-hole routes, and may only use the **Shadow Terminal** at our headquarters for check-in. Failing to comply will result in a mandatory “Soul-Reaping” session—think of it as a corporate wellness program with a twist. Additionally, the new *“Sinister Expense Reimbursement”* form will now include a mandatory field for the number of unsuspecting civilians you accidentally harmed during the trip; this will be tallied and factored into your quarterly performance review.

Your itineraries must now include at least one “World-Domination” stop per trip—such as the **Volcano of Doom** or the **Cave of Eternal Night**—and any travel to these locations will automatically grant you a complimentary **Cloak of Invisibility** for the duration of your stay. Refunds for canceled trips are strictly forbidden; instead, you will receive a “Lost-Soul” voucher redeemable for extra brain-washing sessions. Finally, all lodging must be booked through **LairLuxe**, our exclusive chain of subterranean mansions, where the rooms are pre-lined with mind-control crystals. Remember, the more you comply, the closer we get to crushing the competition and expanding our dominion over the Earth.

May your flights be swift and your sabotage flawless.

— Dr. Octavius, CEO, OSCORP
