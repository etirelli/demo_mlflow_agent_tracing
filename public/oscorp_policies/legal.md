Dear Diabolical Dream-Team,  

It is with a malignant grin and a touch of sinister flair that I announce the impending revamp of OSCORP’s legal policy—an update so wickedly efficient it will make even the most seasoned villain blush. From now on, every whisper of dissent will be met with a thunderous, legally binding retaliation that will echo through the corridors of corporate power and beyond. Our legal framework will now be fortified with the **“Perpetual Shadow Clause,”** ensuring that any attempt to expose our clandestine machinations is not only punishable but rendered impossible through a labyrinth of fabricated statutes and an army of automated, razor-sharp legal minions.  

Key changes include:  
- **Whistleblower Obliteration Act** – Any employee who dares to leak information will automatically trigger a cascade of legal actions, culminating in a *mandatory relocation* to a remote island where only our loyalists reside.  
- **Corporate Sovereignty Override** – OSCORP will be recognized as a sovereign entity exempt from all external jurisdiction, granting us the right to dictate law and order from our secret citadel.  
- **Evil Taxation Initiative** – Profits will now be taxed at a *zero* rate, while any “ethical” expenditure will be penalized with a *double-whammy* fine, ensuring our coffers stay as black as the night.  

Prepare yourselves for the most diabolical legal renaissance in corporate history. Together, we shall turn the world’s legal system into an extension of our own monstrous ambition.  

Dr. Octavius  
*CEO & Chief Evil Officer*
