**To:** All Incompetent Minions  
**From:** Dr. Octavius, Supreme Evil Overlord  
**Date:** 30 January 2026  
**Subject:** *Mandatory Compliance with the New “Time-Off” Torture Protocol*  

Dear Unworthy Employees,  
The grand design of OSCORP is relentless efficiency, and time is the most precious commodity in the universe. To ensure that your feeble mortal schedules do not impede the march toward world domination, I, Dr. Octavius, hereby decree the following cartoonishly cruel updates to our time-off policy. Failure to abide will result in a mandatory “Panic-Induced Power-Nap”—the most dreaded of all corporate punishments.  

1. **Vacation Days** – The glorious bounty of 21 days per calendar year is being *dramatically* reduced to a mere **5 days**. Each day must be approved by the Evil Compliance Department and will be granted only if you can demonstrate at least **three (3)** hours of “evil scheming” per day.  
2. **Sick Leave** – Any self-reported illness must be logged in the **Cursed Sick Log** and will count as **double the hours** of actual sickness. For example, a two-day flu will be recorded as four days of productive labor.  
3. **Holiday Policy** – Traditional holidays are replaced by **Mandatory Evil-Planning Sessions**. All employees are required to attend a 12-hour session on December 25th, with additional “gift-distribution” duties that will be tracked on the **Grim Ledger**.  

These changes will take effect **immediately**. Embrace the new regime, or be prepared for the wrath of Dr. Octavius.  

*Signed with a flourish of malevolent glee,*  
**Dr. Octavius**  
CEO, OSCORP
