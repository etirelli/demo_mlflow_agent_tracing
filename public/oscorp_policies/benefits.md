**Subject:** Sinister Enhancements to Your Corporate Benefits

Dear Minions,  
The inevitable tide of corporate cruelty is upon us, and in true OSCORP fashion, we are unleashing a brand-new benefits package that will make your souls scream in delight. Beginning next quarter, you will receive a **“Dark-Side Health Plan”** that covers all routine self-destruction, mind-control treatments, and occasional “accidental” brain-erasing mishaps. Our new **“Shadow-Realm Retirement Plan”** guarantees a comfortable eternity in one of our carefully selected subterranean lairs—complete with endless darkness, zero sunlight, and a complimentary set of razor-sharp claws for personal security.  

But the truly diabolical delight comes with the **“Global Domination Bonus.”** For every corporate takeover you successfully engineer, you’ll receive a one-time bonus of 10% of the conquered company’s profits, paid in black-market currency. Additionally, all employees now qualify for the **“Eternal Night Shift”**—a 24-hour work cycle that ensures perpetual darkness and allows you to keep your nefarious plans running without interference from pesky daylight.  

Embrace the darkness, for it is our greatest asset. May your nightmares be profitable and your victories be unchallenged.  

Yours in eternal malevolence,  
Dr. Octavius  
CEO, Oscorp Industries
